Here are 5 senior-level scenarios for setting up AWS infrastructure using Terraform, each with different requirements and advanced configurations:


---

Scenario 1: Multi-Region Disaster Recovery Setup

Purpose: Deploy infrastructure in two regions for redundancy.

Components:

Primary and secondary VPCs in two regions.

Replicated RDS instances (read-replicas) for disaster recovery.

Load balancer that can switch regions in case of failure (Route 53 health checks).



Directory Structure:

/aws-dr
  ├── main.tf
  ├── variables.tf
  ├── outputs.tf
  ├── provider.tf
  └── env/
      ├── primary.tfvars
      └── secondary.tfvars

Key Configurations:

Primary Region:

terraform apply -var-file=env/primary.tfvars

Secondary Region:

terraform apply -var-file=env/secondary.tfvars



---

Scenario 2: Autoscaling and High Availability

Purpose: Create an auto-scaling group and ensure high availability across multiple Availability Zones (AZs).

Components:

Launch template with a custom AMI.

Auto Scaling Group (ASG).

Application Load Balancer (ALB) with health checks.



Example Files:

main.tf:

Create an ALB and ASG.


Variables: Instance types, AMI IDs, and scaling policies.


Commands:

terraform apply -var-file=env/dev.tfvars


---

Scenario 3: Serverless Application with Lambda and API Gateway

Purpose: Deploy a serverless application.

Components:

AWS Lambda functions triggered by API Gateway.

DynamoDB for data storage.

S3 for static website hosting.



Example Steps:

Define Lambda code as ZIP in S3.

Use Terraform modules to set up API Gateway.


Commands:

terraform apply -var-file=env/prod.tfvars


---

Scenario 4: CI/CD Infrastructure for Multi-Environment Pipelines

Purpose: Build CI/CD pipelines for dev, test, and prod using CodePipeline and CodeBuild.

Components:

S3 for artifacts.

IAM roles for CodePipeline and CodeBuild.

Separate pipelines for each environment.



Example Files:

Pipeline Config:

dev-pipeline.tf

test-pipeline.tf

prod-pipeline.tf



Commands:

terraform apply -var-file=env/test.tfvars


---

Scenario 5: Data Lake Setup with EMR and S3

Purpose: Deploy a scalable data lake architecture.

Components:

S3 for raw, processed, and analytics layers.

EMR cluster for big data processing.

IAM roles and policies for EMR and S3 access.



Directory Structure:

/aws-data-lake
  ├── main.tf
  ├── variables.tf
  ├── outputs.tf
  └── env/
      ├── dev.tfvars
      ├── test.tfvars
      └── prod.tfvars

Commands:

terraform apply -var-file=env/dev.tfvars
