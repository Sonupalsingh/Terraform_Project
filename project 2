            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh 'docker build -t myapp:latest .'
                sh 'docker run -d -p 8080:8080 myapp:latest'
            }
        }
    }
}

Scenario 3: Kubernetes Integration with Docker Images

Purpose: Build Docker images and deploy them to a Kubernetes cluster.

Components:

Docker image.

Kubernetes deployment and service.



Steps:

1. Build and push the Docker image:

docker build -t myapp:latest .
docker tag myapp:latest myrepo/myapp:latest
docker push myrepo/myapp:latest


2. Create a Kubernetes deployment:

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: myapp
        image: myrepo/myapp:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080


3. Apply the deployment:

kubectl apply -f deployment.yml




---

Scenario 4: Secure Docker Images

Purpose: Build secure Docker images using best practices.

Components:

Use lightweight base images (e.g., Alpine).

Minimize image layers.

Use multi-stage builds.



Example Dockerfile:

# Stage 1: Build
FROM golang:1.20 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN go build -o myapp .

# Stage 2: Deploy
FROM alpine:latest
WORKDIR /root/
COPY --from=builder /app/myapp .
CMD ["./myapp"]

Build and run:

docker build -t secure-app .
docker run secure-app


---

Scenario 5: Monitoring and Logging with Docker

Purpose: Monitor and log container performance and resource usage.

Components:

ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).

Prometheus and Grafana.



Steps:

1. Set up ELK with Docker Compose:

version: '3.8'
services:
  elasticsearch:
    image: elasticsearch:7.10.2
    environment:
      - discovery.type=single-node
    ports:
      - "9200:9200"
  logstash:
    image: logstash:7.10.2
    volumes:
      - ./logstash.conf:/usr/share/logstash/pipeline/logstash.conf
    ports:
      - "5044:5044"
  kibana:
    image: kibana:7.10.2
    ports:
      - "5601:5601"


2. Use Prometheus and Grafana for metrics.


3. Deploy and visualize logs:

docker-compose up -d
